# Installation using pip

You can use a pip-based installation if you simply
want to use hydrolib-core, without making contributions
to the package yourself.

You should be able to install hydrolib-core with:
``` bash
pip install hydrolib-core
```

<!--- or if you prefer (especially on Windows)

``` bash
conda install hydrolib-core -c conda-forge
```

!!! note
    If you use `conda`, it's advisable to install hydrolib-core
    within a new environment with only `conda-forge` as channel.

After successful installation, you should be able to do the ["First steps" tutorial](../tutorials/steps.md).
