# Installation

You should be able to install hydrolib-core with:
``` bash
pip install hydrolib-core
```

or if you prefer (especially on Windows)

``` bash
conda install hydrolib-core -c conda-forge
```

!!! note
    If you use `conda`, it's advisable to install hydrolib-core
    within a new environment with only `conda-forge` as channel.
